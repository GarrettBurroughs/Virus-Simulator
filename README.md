# Virus-Simulator
A very basic simulator and visualizer for how viruses spread

Note: this is just a fun project I worked on while on lockdown. It follows a very basic mathematical model, and while it may mimic how things work in the 
real world, it is not a good indicator or predictor on how a virus will spread during a pandemic

This project uses the [milligram](https://milligram.io/#getting-started) css framwork and [chartjs](https://www.chartjs.org/)
